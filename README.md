# School-Projects
All school projects worked on 2015-2019

Various school assignments requiring programming.  

Often not written for readability but instead to meet certain requirements. 
Often not concise or using the best methods, for the purpose of learning various methods of coding.  

Some of the projects contain code given in the project statement and is not my own.
